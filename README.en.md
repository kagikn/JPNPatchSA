# JPNPatchSA
This asi makes it possible to display Shift JIS (CP932) characters in GTA San Andreas. This mod is ported from jontamasan's Japanese loader for GTA SA and removed unnesessary patching, and it doesn't cause the glitch where the fire rates of plane arms is unintentionally reduced by 75%.

## How to use
1. Install any asi loader
1. Put JPNPatchSA.asi at the right directory (Generally the game root directory or scripts folder)

## Supported versions
* v1.0 US (Hoodlum)
* v1.0 EU
* v1.01 US
* v1.01 EU

## Notice
* If you try to use this asi in unsupported version, it will prevent the game from launching not to corrupt memory.
* Windows 2000 and Windows 9x is not supported.

## Lisence
