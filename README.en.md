# JPNPatchSA
This asi makes it possible to display Shift JIS (CP932) characters in GTA San Andreas. This mod is ported from jontamasan's Japanese translation exe for GTA SA without unnesessary patching. Unlike the original translation exe, this asi doesn't introduce several glitches, such as the glitch where the helicopters or airplanes have only 25% rates of fire.

## How to use
1. Install any asi loader
1. Put JPNPatchSA.asi at the right directory (Generally the game root directory or scripts folder)

## Supported versions
* v1.0 US (Hoodlum)
* v1.0 EU
* v1.01 US
* v1.01 EU

## Notice
* If you try to use this asi in unsupported version, the asi will stop the game launching not to corrupt memory.
* Windows 2000 and Windows 9x is not supported.

## Lisence
